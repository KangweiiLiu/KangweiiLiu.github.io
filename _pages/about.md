<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I'm Kangwei Liu (刘康威), a Ph.D. candidate in Institute of Information Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences (IIE, CAS), under the tutelage of Prof. Xianfeng Zhao and Associate Prof. Yun Cao. My research interests include Audio-driven Talking Face Generation and Facial Animation.

I received my B.E. degree from College of Computer Science and Engineering, Northeastern University and was mentored by Prof. Peng Cao at NEU.

I am open for collaborations in research, especially in the fields of Audio-driven Talking Face Generation and Facial Animation. Please feel free to contact me.

[ProDub: Progressive Growing of Facial Dubbing Networks for Enhanced Lip Sync and Fidelity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoGOMiomJjM)

**Kangwei Liu**, Xiaowei Yi, Xianfeng Zhao

[**Demo Video**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoGOMiomJjM)
- TL;DR: A progressive framework for facial dubbing that disentangles mouth shape and texture for better lip-sync, while enhancing visual quality through a lip-aware temporal network. Improves lip-sync by 10.7% and visual quality by 28.5% over SOTA methods.

[Controllable Expressive 3D Facial Animation via Diffusion in a Unified Multimodal Space](https://kangweiiliu.github.io/Control3DAnimation)

**Kangwei Liu**, Junwu Liu, Xiaowei Yi, Jinlin Guo, Yun Cao

[**Project Page**](https://kangweiiliu.github.io/Control_3D_Animation)
- TL;DR: A diffusion-based framework for 3D facial animation that unifies multiple control signals (text, audio, emotion labels) and generates diverse, temporally coherent facial expressions, achieving 21.6% improvement in emotion similarity while maintaining natural dynamics.

[DisentTalk: Cross-lingual Talking Face Generation via Semantic Disentangled Diffusion Model](https://kangweiiliu.github.io/DisentTalk)

**Kangwei Liu**, Junwu Liu, Yun Cao, Jinlin Guo, Xiaowei Yi

[**Project Page**](https://kangweiiliu.github.io/DisentTalk)
- TL;DR: A novel approach that decomposes 3DMM expression parameters into meaningful subspaces for fine-grained facial control, enabling cross-lingual talking face generation with superior lip synchronization, expression quality, and temporal consistency.
